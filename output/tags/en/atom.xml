&#65533;&#65533;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="487"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;487. COMET ELENIN C/2010 X1&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;Perihelion: 2011 September 10.72, q = 0.482 AU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;This has, undoubtedly, been one of the most 
eagerly-awaited comets in recent years. It was discovered back on 
December 10, 2010 by Leonid Elenin, an astronomer in Lyubertsy, Russia 
(affiliated with the &lt;a href="http://www.keldysh.ru"&gt;Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;
 in Moscow), who is an accomplished observer of comets and who has in 
fact made several recoveries of expected periodic comets within the 
fairly recent past; this is his first comet discovery. Leonid was 
observing remotely with a 45-cm (18-inch) telescope (equipped with a 
CCD) at the &lt;a href="http://spaceobs.org/en/observatory"&gt;International Scientific Optical Network observatory&lt;/a&gt;
 in New Mexico (not too far from where I live, incidentally), and at the
 time of his discovery the comet was a rather faint object between 19th 
and 20th magnitudes and was located 4.2 AU from the sun.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;The first calculated orbits for Comet Elenin 
suggested it would remain a distant object, however it soon became clear
 that it was traveling on a remarkably low-inclination orbit (1.8 
degrees) that would carry it quite close to both the sun and the earth. 
Furthermore, the geometry for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_scatter"&gt;forward scattering&lt;/a&gt;
 of sunlight -- and thus an accompanying brightness enhancement -- is 
quite favorable around that time. All this has led to a realization that
 Comet Elenin possesses at least the potential to become a relatively 
bright object -- conceivably even a "Great Comet" -- for a brief period 
of time around perihelion passage and its closest approach to Earth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Following its discovery Comet Elenin slowly 
brightened as it approached the sun and Earth, and it went through 
opposition in mid-March of this year. Towards the end of that month I 
broke out the Earthrise telescope/CCD system (that has been dormant for a
 few years amongst all the transitions both Earthrise and I are 
undergoing) and managed to obtain some &lt;a href="http://www.earthriseinstitute.org/new.html#x1"&gt;images&lt;/a&gt;
 of the comet as a faint object near magnitude 15&#65533;1/2 or 16. I also 
began visual searches for it around that time, however it remained 
elusive for quite some time thereafter. Finally, on the evening of May 
23 I suspected it as a very faint, diffuse and "soft" object a little 
fainter than 14th magnitude, and was able to verify this as being the 
comet by observations on several additional nights over the subsequent 
week. (This confirmation process was hindered some by the fact that the 
comet was at its stationary point, and thus hardly moved at all from 
night to night.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;The comet is currently an evening-sky object, located in western Leo some six degrees southeast of the bright star &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulus"&gt;Regulus&lt;/a&gt; and two degrees southwest of the star &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_Leonis"&gt;Rho Leonis&lt;/a&gt;.
 Over the coming several weeks it tracks to the east-southeast across 
Leo roughly parallel to the ecliptic, until finally it enters western 
Virgo in early August. Its elongation from the sun at that time will 
have shrunk to 40 degrees, and since it will be south of the sun 
observations may be difficult from the northern hemisphere but should 
still be fairly easy from the southern. Even though the elongation 
continues to decrease after that, since the sun is moving southward we 
northern hemisphere observers may be able to keep following it for a 
while, perhaps even up until the time of perihelion passage when the 
elongation will be 26 degrees. After that its motion on the sky reverses
 as it crosses almost directly between the earth and the sun, passing 
less than two degrees north of the sun on September 26.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;By the end of the first week of October Comet 
Elenin will emerge into the morning sky, traveling rapidly 
west-northwestward through Leo and passing six degrees north of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulus"&gt;Regulus&lt;/a&gt;
 on October 11. It makes its closest approach to Earth (0.23 AU) on 
October 16 and travels rapidly through Cancer and Gemini around this 
time (passing just one degree north of the bright star &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollux_%28star%29"&gt;Pollux&lt;/a&gt;
 on October 22), then enters Auriga shortly before the end of October 
and then northern Taurus at the end of the first week of November. The 
comet is at opposition shortly after the middle of that month, and then 
passes through the northern regions of the &lt;a href="http://seds.org/messier/m/m045.html"&gt;Pleiades&lt;/a&gt;
 star cluster on November 23. At the end of that month it crosses into 
eastern Aries, where it remains up through the end of January 2012.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Brightness predictions for any potentially bright
 comet like this one are always problematical. Unfortunately, the news 
thus far for Comet Elenin is not especially good; it is already running 
somewhat behind the original expectations, and the distinctly diffuse 
and uncondensed appearance it is currently exhibiting visually is also 
not a good sign. Furthermore, calculations now clearly show that Comet 
Elenin is making its first visit to the inner solar system from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud"&gt;Oort Cloud&lt;/a&gt;,
 and such comets quite often tend to appear relatively bright when far 
from the sun but under-perform as they approach and pass through 
perihelion. (The most famous, or infamous, example is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Kohoutek"&gt;Comet Kohoutek 1973f&lt;/a&gt; (no. 10), but compared to some Oort Cloud comets even it did not perform all that poorly.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;With all this in mind, a cautiously optimistic 
scenario would suggest that Comet Elenin might reach 10th magnitude by 
early August when it becomes a somewhat difficult object from the 
northern hemisphere, and may brighten further to around 6th magnitude by
 the time it passes through perihelion. It may still be near this 
brightness when it reappears in the morning sky in early October, and 
then might fade slowly by perhaps half a magnitude by the time it is 
nearest Earth. Fading may be more rapid thereafter, with the comet's 
being perhaps 10th or 11th magnitude when near opposition in November, 
and no brighter than perhaps 13th magnitude by the end of the year. As I
 mentioned above, there is a potential for a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_scatter"&gt;forward scattering&lt;/a&gt;
 enhancement of brightness (perhaps by as much as a couple of 
magnitudes) in late September when the comet passes almost directly 
between the Earth and the sun, however this will probably be fairly 
short-lived and, more importantly, this will occur when the comet is at a
 very small elongation from the sun. (The LASCO coronagraphs aboard the &lt;a href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov"&gt;SOHO spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; should nevertheless be able to provide a spectacular view.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;This is only a guide, of course; the comet could 
easily be one, or two, or more, magnitudes brighter, or fainter, than 
this. Conceivably, it could fragment as it passes through perihelion and
 come out distinctly brighter that it was earlier; on the other hand, it
 could break apart completely and disintegrate as it passes through 
perihelion. There is precedent for both scenarios, as well as precedent 
for "normal" behavior. We'll just have to wait and see what the comet 
actually does.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Unfortunately, some elements in our society have 
latched onto the news about Comet Elenin and have been promulgating 
various apocalyptic scenarios regarding it. (I will not link to any of 
those, or give them any more publicity than they deserve.) Some of these
 have gone so far as to question Leonid Elenin's existence as an actual 
person. (I can assure "Countdown" participants that he is a real person;
 while I have not met him, I correspond with him on a fairly regular 
basis.) Many of these scenarios are almost identical to the nonsense 
that I remember combatting when &lt;a href="http://www.earthriseinstitute.org/comims2.html"&gt;Comet Hale-Bopp&lt;/a&gt;
 (no. 199) was around 14 years ago -- with some of these being put out 
by the same people! -- and, needless to say, we're all still here. There
 is, in fact, nothing all that unusual about Comet Elenin; it does have 
the potential to become somewhat bright, and it does come somewhat close
 to Earth (although several comets, including at least three earlier 
"Countdown" comets, have come closer to Earth during recent years), but 
there is nothing of any kind to fear. Let's enjoy whatever show it gives
 us.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;My personal life has been very busy of late. I'm currently tripled up on the classes I'm teaching as part of my &lt;a href="http://amu.apus.edu"&gt;day job&lt;/a&gt;
 (including a course in Planetary Science that I'm teaching for the 
first time), and once again I'll be teaching classes as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/spaceacademy"&gt;Summer Science Camps&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.nmspacemuseum.org"&gt;New Mexico Museum of Space History&lt;/a&gt; in Alamogordo. I've recently joined the &lt;a href="http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/team_members.php"&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.icarusinterstellar.org"&gt;Project Icarus&lt;/a&gt;,
 and am also exploring several additional potentially exciting 
opportunities for Earthrise-related endeavors that I'll hopefully be 
able to report positively upon within the not-too-distant future. Our &lt;a href="http://www.cloudcrofttheatre.com"&gt;local acting troupe&lt;/a&gt; has just completed its &lt;a href="http://www.cloudcrofttheatre.com/11-05-20mayfest/110520.htm"&gt;first play&lt;/a&gt;
 of the current summer season, and, once again, I played the part of the
 villain. (Am I being typecast?) And, as if I need reminding that I've 
been hanging around this planet for a good long while, my &lt;a href="http://www.aps4kids.org/AlamogordoHigh.cfm?subpage=41787"&gt;High School&lt;/a&gt;
 graduating class is celebrating its 35th reunion this coming weekend. 
Finally, my relationship with my girlfriend Susanne continues to 
develop, and it's conceivable I may have something positive to report 
about that within the not-too-very-distant future. Life continues, then,
 to be very fulfilling, as I continue my quest for the comets . . .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
