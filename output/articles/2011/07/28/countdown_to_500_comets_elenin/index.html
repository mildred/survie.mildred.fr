                          					<p><font size="4">This has, undoubtedly, been one of the most 
                          eagerly-awaited comets in recent years. It was discovered back on 
                          December 10, 2010 by Leonid Elenin, an astronomer in Lyubertsy, Russia 
                          (affiliated with the <a href="http://www.keldysh.ru">Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics</a>
                           in Moscow), who is an accomplished observer of comets and who has in 
                          fact made several recoveries of expected periodic comets within the 
                          fairly recent past; this is his first comet discovery. Leonid was 
                          observing remotely with a 45-cm (18-inch) telescope (equipped with a 
                          CCD) at the <a href="http://spaceobs.org/en/observatory">International Scientific Optical Network observatory</a>
                           in New Mexico (not too far from where I live, incidentally), and at the
                           time of his discovery the comet was a rather faint object between 19th 
                          and 20th magnitudes and was located 4.2 AU from the sun.</font></p>
                          					<p><font size="4">The first calculated orbits for Comet Elenin 
                          suggested it would remain a distant object, however it soon became clear
                           that it was traveling on a remarkably low-inclination orbit (1.8 
                          degrees) that would carry it quite close to both the sun and the earth. 
                          Furthermore, the geometry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_scatter">forward scattering</a>
                           of sunlight -- and thus an accompanying brightness enhancement -- is 
                          quite favorable around that time. All this has led to a realization that
                           Comet Elenin possesses at least the potential to become a relatively 
                          bright object -- conceivably even a "Great Comet" -- for a brief period 
                          of time around perihelion passage and its closest approach to Earth.</font></p>
                          					<p><font size="4">Following its discovery Comet Elenin slowly 
                          brightened as it approached the sun and Earth, and it went through 
                          opposition in mid-March of this year. Towards the end of that month I 
                          broke out the Earthrise telescope/CCD system (that has been dormant for a
                           few years amongst all the transitions both Earthrise and I are 
                          undergoing) and managed to obtain some <a href="http://www.earthriseinstitute.org/new.html#x1">images</a>
                           of the comet as a faint object near magnitude 15�1/2 or 16. I also 
                          began visual searches for it around that time, however it remained 
                          elusive for quite some time thereafter. Finally, on the evening of May 
                          23 I suspected it as a very faint, diffuse and "soft" object a little 
                          fainter than 14th magnitude, and was able to verify this as being the 
                          comet by observations on several additional nights over the subsequent 
                          week. (This confirmation process was hindered some by the fact that the 
                          comet was at its stationary point, and thus hardly moved at all from 
                          night to night.)</font></p>
                          					<p><font size="4">The comet is currently an evening-sky object, located in western Leo some six degrees southeast of the bright star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulus">Regulus</a> and two degrees southwest of the star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_Leonis">Rho Leonis</a>.
                           Over the coming several weeks it tracks to the east-southeast across 
                          Leo roughly parallel to the ecliptic, until finally it enters western 
                          Virgo in early August. Its elongation from the sun at that time will 
                          have shrunk to 40 degrees, and since it will be south of the sun 
                          observations may be difficult from the northern hemisphere but should 
                          still be fairly easy from the southern. Even though the elongation 
                          continues to decrease after that, since the sun is moving southward we 
                          northern hemisphere observers may be able to keep following it for a 
                          while, perhaps even up until the time of perihelion passage when the 
                          elongation will be 26 degrees. After that its motion on the sky reverses
                           as it crosses almost directly between the earth and the sun, passing 
                          less than two degrees north of the sun on September 26.</font></p>
                          					<p><font size="4">By the end of the first week of October Comet 
                          Elenin will emerge into the morning sky, traveling rapidly 
                          west-northwestward through Leo and passing six degrees north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulus">Regulus</a>
                           on October 11. It makes its closest approach to Earth (0.23 AU) on 
                          October 16 and travels rapidly through Cancer and Gemini around this 
                          time (passing just one degree north of the bright star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollux_%28star%29">Pollux</a>
                           on October 22), then enters Auriga shortly before the end of October 
                          and then northern Taurus at the end of the first week of November. The 
                          comet is at opposition shortly after the middle of that month, and then 
                          passes through the northern regions of the <a href="http://seds.org/messier/m/m045.html">Pleiades</a>
                           star cluster on November 23. At the end of that month it crosses into 
                          eastern Aries, where it remains up through the end of January 2012.</font></p>
                          					<p><font size="4">Brightness predictions for any potentially bright
                           comet like this one are always problematical. Unfortunately, the news 
                          thus far for Comet Elenin is not especially good; it is already running 
                          somewhat behind the original expectations, and the distinctly diffuse 
                          and uncondensed appearance it is currently exhibiting visually is also 
                          not a good sign. Furthermore, calculations now clearly show that Comet 
                          Elenin is making its first visit to the inner solar system from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud">Oort Cloud</a>,
                           and such comets quite often tend to appear relatively bright when far 
                          from the sun but under-perform as they approach and pass through 
                          perihelion. (The most famous, or infamous, example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Kohoutek">Comet Kohoutek 1973f</a> (no. 10), but compared to some Oort Cloud comets even it did not perform all that poorly.)</font></p>
                          					<p><font size="4">With all this in mind, a cautiously optimistic 
                          scenario would suggest that Comet Elenin might reach 10th magnitude by 
                          early August when it becomes a somewhat difficult object from the 
                          northern hemisphere, and may brighten further to around 6th magnitude by
                           the time it passes through perihelion. It may still be near this 
                          brightness when it reappears in the morning sky in early October, and 
                          then might fade slowly by perhaps half a magnitude by the time it is 
                          nearest Earth. Fading may be more rapid thereafter, with the comet's 
                          being perhaps 10th or 11th magnitude when near opposition in November, 
                          and no brighter than perhaps 13th magnitude by the end of the year. As I
                           mentioned above, there is a potential for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_scatter">forward scattering</a>
                           enhancement of brightness (perhaps by as much as a couple of 
                          magnitudes) in late September when the comet passes almost directly 
                          between the Earth and the sun, however this will probably be fairly 
                          short-lived and, more importantly, this will occur when the comet is at a
                           very small elongation from the sun. (The LASCO coronagraphs aboard the <a href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov">SOHO spacecraft</a> should nevertheless be able to provide a spectacular view.)</font></p>
                          					<p><font size="4">This is only a guide, of course; the comet could 
                          easily be one, or two, or more, magnitudes brighter, or fainter, than 
                          this. Conceivably, it could fragment as it passes through perihelion and
                           come out distinctly brighter that it was earlier; on the other hand, it
                           could break apart completely and disintegrate as it passes through 
                          perihelion. There is precedent for both scenarios, as well as precedent 
                          for "normal" behavior. We'll just have to wait and see what the comet 
                          actually does.</font></p>
                          					<p><font size="4">Unfortunately, some elements in our society have 
                          latched onto the news about Comet Elenin and have been promulgating 
                          various apocalyptic scenarios regarding it. (I will not link to any of 
                          those, or give them any more publicity than they deserve.) Some of these
                           have gone so far as to question Leonid Elenin's existence as an actual 
                          person. (I can assure "Countdown" participants that he is a real person;
                           while I have not met him, I correspond with him on a fairly regular 
                          basis.) Many of these scenarios are almost identical to the nonsense 
                          that I remember combatting when <a href="http://www.earthriseinstitute.org/comims2.html">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>
                           (no. 199) was around 14 years ago -- with some of these being put out 
                          by the same people! -- and, needless to say, we're all still here. There
                           is, in fact, nothing all that unusual about Comet Elenin; it does have 
                          the potential to become somewhat bright, and it does come somewhat close
                           to Earth (although several comets, including at least three earlier 
                          "Countdown" comets, have come closer to Earth during recent years), but 
                          there is nothing of any kind to fear. Let's enjoy whatever show it gives
                           us.</font></p>
                          					<p><font size="4">My personal life has been very busy of late. I'm currently tripled up on the classes I'm teaching as part of my <a href="http://amu.apus.edu">day job</a>
                           (including a course in Planetary Science that I'm teaching for the 
                          first time), and once again I'll be teaching classes as part of the <a href="http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/spaceacademy">Summer Science Camps</a> at the <a href="http://www.nmspacemuseum.org">New Mexico Museum of Space History</a> in Alamogordo. I've recently joined the <a href="http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/team_members.php">team</a> of <a href="http://www.icarusinterstellar.org">Project Icarus</a>,
                           and am also exploring several additional potentially exciting 
                          opportunities for Earthrise-related endeavors that I'll hopefully be 
                          able to report positively upon within the not-too-distant future. Our <a href="http://www.cloudcrofttheatre.com">local acting troupe</a> has just completed its <a href="http://www.cloudcrofttheatre.com/11-05-20mayfest/110520.htm">first play</a>
                           of the current summer season, and, once again, I played the part of the
                           villain. (Am I being typecast?) And, as if I need reminding that I've 
                          been hanging around this planet for a good long while, my <a href="http://www.aps4kids.org/AlamogordoHigh.cfm?subpage=41787">High School</a>
                           graduating class is celebrating its 35th reunion this coming weekend. 
                          Finally, my relationship with my girlfriend Susanne continues to 
                          develop, and it's conceivable I may have something positive to report 
                          about that within the not-too-very-distant future. Life continues, then,
                           to be very fulfilling, as I continue my quest for the comets . . .</font></p>
